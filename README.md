# Base Apparel Coming soon page - Frontend Mentor

Front-end coding challenge proposed by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
